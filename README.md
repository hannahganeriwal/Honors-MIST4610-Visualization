## Describing your dataset and what data it contains:

Where was it obtained, what are the dimensions of it (rows and columns), what are the various columns, data types, etc. Describe it in sufficient detail so that an uninformed reader would understand the dataset.


## Question 1: What are the leading causes of death in Georgia for 2017?

### Importance: 
This graph shows the causes of death in the state of Georgia just for 2017. With this being said, the 2 leading causes of death in Georgia were both Cancer and Heart Disease by at least 12,000. 
Visualizing this graph could be crucial for various reasons. Firstly, it provides a concise overview of the leading causes of mortality in the state, allowing healthcare professionals and public health officials to identify and prioritize areas for intervention and resource allocation. By visually representing the distribution of deaths across different causes, both as a percentage and count, policymakers can gain insights into the prevalent health issues within the population and tailor preventive strategies accordingly. Limiting the visualization to just one year can also be impactful as it analyzes trends and patterns within that specific time frame. It allows for the identification of any sudden changes or fluctuations in mortality rates, which may indicate emerging health threats or shifts in disease burden. By doing this also focuses on the current population, as the population in Georgia significantly increases overtime. So, after thorough analysis of the visualization I created, it was interesting to note how huge heart disease and cancer caused death. This graph showed the total deaths in Georgia in 2017 which was 60,932 and the 2 leading factors combined equal 58.30% of the total deaths which is substantial. To put this into a broader perspective, around every 6 out of 10 people die from either, which further implies the need for interventions to help decrease these numbers. 

### Manipulations: 
In regards to manipulations to this dataset, I had to filter out both the United States in the state column and All causes in the cause name column. Both of these showed the total number of deaths within the US or total number of deaths in that year, which ended up skewing the data heavily. So, filtering those two out normalizes the set and allows for an easy read. Additionally, on the analytics tab, in order to find out the grand total of deaths in the state, I had to bring over totals so that I could calculate the percentage of deaths that were led from heart disease and cancer. I then decided to put both of these graphs in a dashboard because although they show the same thing, I wanted to examine based on percentage and the actual numbers and the grand total.
